# COVID-19 vs Market with Eikon Data API
A Jupyter Notebook that uses Eikon Data API to compare financial timeseries with the spread of COVID-19.

COVID-19 data is retrieved from https://github.com/novelcovid/api.

To use this model, simply input a RIC into the main function - compare() and the script will produce a plotly chart comparing the timeseries of COVID-19 cases and the financial instrument of your choice.
